# Computer Vision

A collection of computer vision projects spanning photo and video methods. These projects formed the basis for a project involving [pose detection for tennis players](https://github.com/tanaynistala/tennis), but the concepts covered in these notebooks cover a wide range of topics in deep learning, like convolutional neural networks.
